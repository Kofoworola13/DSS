# 🚀 Machine Learning Challenge: 6 Months Journey with Hands-On Machine Learning  

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Challenge** repository! This project is my structured journey through the renowned book, **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** by Aurélien Géron. Over 6 months, I aim to gain a solid foundation in Machine Learning by systematically studying the book and applying the concepts through exercises and projects.
