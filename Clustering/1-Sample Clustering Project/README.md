# Sample Clustering Project ðŸ“Š

This project is based on a clustering assignment task that demonstrates the application of clustering techniques. You can review the details and solution of the assignment here: [Clustering Challenge Notebook](https://github.com/Kofoworola13/ml-basics/blob/master/challenges/04%20-%20Clustering%20Challenge.ipynb). It demonstrates the general steps involved in clustering using a sample dataset. The focus is on applying clustering techniques and interpreting results, rather than performing an in-depth analysis.

## **Project Components**

1. **Dataset**:
   - A sample dataset is used to illustrate clustering techniques. Preprocessing steps are included to prepare the data for analysis.

2. **Algorithms Implemented**:
   - **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**: Applied to group data points based on hierarchical relationships, with results interpreted to understand cluster formation.

3. **Determining the Number of Clusters**:
   - Various techniques were used to determine the optimal number of clusters, helping to refine the clustering results.

4. **Interactive Widget**:
   - An interactive widget was included to adjust the algorithm and the number of clusters. This feature allows for demonstration and visualization of how changes affect the clustering outcome.


## Key Learning Outcomes

- **Understanding Clustering Algorithms**: I gained practical experience with Agglomerative Clustering and its interpretation.
- **Determining Optimal Clusters**: I applied methods to find the ideal number of clusters for the dataset.
- **Interactive Visualization**: I used an interactive widget to explore the effects of different algorithms and cluster numbers.
