# Clustering Overview ðŸ“š

Welcome to my Clustering repository! This section provides an in-depth look at my learning journey with clustering techniques, highlighting the resources and materials I've used to deepen my understanding.

## Introduction to Clustering

[Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#) is an unsupervised learning method used to group similar data points based on their features. Unlike supervised learning, where the model is trained with labelled data, clustering works with unlabeled data to uncover inherent patterns and structures. Hereâ€™s a closer look at key aspects of clustering:

### **Core Concepts**

- **Similarity Measurement**: Clustering relies on measures of similarity or distance between data points. Common distance metrics include Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine similarity.
  
- **Cluster Formation**: The goal is to partition data into clusters where points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Clustering algorithms use different approaches to form these groups.

### **Popular Clustering Algorithms**

1. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - **Concept**: Divides data into `K` clusters by iteratively assigning data points to the nearest cluster centre and updating the centres.
   - **Use Case**: Effective for large datasets where the number of clusters is known or can be estimated.

2. **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**:
   - **Concept**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters by progressively merging or splitting clusters based on distance metrics.
   - **Use Case**: Useful for understanding the data structure at different levels of granularity.

3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**:
   - **Concept**: Identifies clusters based on the density of data points, distinguishing between core points, border points, and outliers.
   - **Use Case**: Effective for data with clusters of varying shapes and densities, and handling noise.

### **Applications of Clustering**

- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behaviour to tailor marketing strategies.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual data points that do not fit well into any cluster.
- **Data Summarization**: Reducing the complexity of data by grouping similar items.

### Key Learning Resources

Here are some valuable resources that have guided my learning process:

1. **[Clustering Basics and Practical Applications](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/5-Clustering)**: This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive set of materials and code examples for understanding clustering techniques. Itâ€™s been instrumental in my learning process.

2. **[Microsoft Learn: Train and Evaluate Cluster Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/train-evaluate-cluster-models/)**: A detailed module from Microsoft Learn that offers in-depth tutorials and exercises on training and evaluating clustering models. Itâ€™s been a key resource for practical insights and hands-on practice.

3. **[Clustering Challenge Notebook](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/ml-basics/blob/master/challenges/04%20-%20Clustering%20Challenge.ipynb)**: This Jupyter notebook contains an assignment task that Iâ€™ve worked on, showcasing my approach to solving clustering challenges. It includes problem statements, code implementations, and results. 

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Iâ€™ll be diving deeper into clustering algorithms, experimenting with different techniques, and applying them to various datasets. This repository will be updated with my findings, project-specific details, and new resources as I progress.

Feel free to explore the resources, review my assignments, and follow along with my learning journey!
