# üìà Time Series Analysis
This directory showcases my work on time series projects, encompassing data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. Below, you'll find detailed descriptions of the files and notebooks included.

## üìö What is Time Series Analysis?

Time Series Analysis involves methods for analyzing time-ordered data points to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and seasonal effects. The core objective is understanding the data's past behavior, predicting future values, and identifying any temporal dependencies.

### Key Components of Time Series Analysis:

1. **Trend**: Long-term movement in the data. Identifying trends helps to understand the direction in which the data is moving over an extended period.
2. **Seasonality**: Repeating patterns or cycles within the time series data at regular intervals. For example, retail sales may peak during the holiday season.
3. **Noise**: Random variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality. Properly managing noise helps to improve model accuracy.
4. **Stationarity**: A time series is stationary if its statistical properties, such as mean and variance, are constant over time. Many time series models require stationary data to make accurate predictions.

### Common Time Series Models:

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A popular model for forecasting and analyzing time series data. ARIMA combines autoregressive (AR) terms, differencing (I), and moving average (MA) terms.
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Techniques such as STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess) that separate a time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
- **Exponential Smoothing**: Methods like Holt-Winters that apply smoothing techniques to forecast future values.

Time series analysis is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, weather forecasting, and inventory management, to make informed decisions based on historical data.

## üìäProjects and Notebooks

In this folder, you'll find projects and notebooks related to time series analysis. These include:

- [**Time Series Visualization**](https://github.com/Kofoworola13/DSS/blob/main/Time%20Series/Visualizing_Time_Series_Datasets.ipynb): This notebook introduces time series data analysis, covering data loading, visualization, and identifying key characteristics such as trends, seasonality, etc. It lays the groundwork for deeper analysis and modeling in the future.

- [**Predicting BTC prices using ARIMA Modeling**](): This notebook focuses on applying ARIMA modeling to time series data. It covers initial steps like data preparation and model building, laying the groundwork for further exploration and improvement in time series analysis.
